## Info on data
* Education (1 = UG1, 2 = UG2, 3 = UG3, 4 = PhD, 5 = PG (postgrad), 6 = Other)
* Gender (1 = Male, 2 = Female, 3 = Non-binary, 4 = Prefer not to say)
* Handedness (1 = left, 2 = Right, 3 = Both)
* Self_ID (self identification; 1 = Dyslexia, 2 = ADD (Attention-Deficit disorder), 3 = AnxD (Anxiety disorder), 4 = ADHD (Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder), 5 = ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder), 6 = NOTA (None of the above))
* AQ10_Scoring are the scores for the AQ-10. Officially a score higher than 6 is indicative of autistic traits, however since I only have 30 participants and only 1 scored a 7/10 (highest score across all 30 people), I thought that for the sake of my study, I would consider a score of 0 to 2 low, 3 to 4 'standard' and 5 to 7 high.
